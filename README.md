# Gopher+ Protocol

This repository contains the 'memo' for the Gopher+ protocol (an extension of the original Gopher protocol as defined in [RFC1436](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1436)):

  - **[`gopherplus.txt`](https://github.com/gopher-protocol/gopher-plus/blob/main/gopherplus.txt)** Original & unmodified text file from 1993.
  - **[`gopherplus.md`](https://github.com/gopher-protocol/gopher-plus/blob/main/gopherplus.md)** Reformatted markdown memo (with minor typo corrections).

## Why
The original memo was formatted as a raw text file with manual line-wrapping.  It also contained various miscellaneous punctuation and spelling typos.

The memo has been reformatted to Markdown format (with minor corrections to typos) to make it easier to read for developers implementing Gopher+ support and hosted in a Git repo to make contributions and corrections easier.

**No "editorial" changes have been made.**
