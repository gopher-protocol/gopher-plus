# Gopher+ Protocol

This repository contains the 'memo' for the Gopher+ protocol (an extension of the original Gopher protocol as defined in [RFC1436](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1436)):

  - **[`gopherplus.txt`](https://github.com/gopher-protocol/gopher-plus/blob/main/gopherplus.txt)** Original & unmodified text file from 1993.
  - **[`gopherplus.md`](https://github.com/gopher-protocol/gopher-plus/blob/main/gopherplus.md)** Reformatted markdown memo (with minor typo corrections).

## Why
The original memo was formatted as a raw text file with manual line-wrapping, and was never an official RFC so is not available from the `ietf.org` site.  It also contained various miscellaneous punctuation and spelling typos. 

The memo has been reformatted to Markdown format (with minor corrections to typos) and hosted on Github to make it easier to find/read/use/correct for developers who are implementing Gopher+ support.

**No "editorial" changes have been made.**
